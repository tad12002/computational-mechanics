## Problems [Part 1](./01_Cheers_Stats_Beers.md)

1. Gordon Moore created an empirical prediction that the rate of
semiconductors on a computer chip would double every two years. This
prediction was known as Moore's law. Gordon Moore had originally only
expected this empirical relation to hold from 1965 - 1975
[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law),[2](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/gordon-moore-the-man-whose-name-means-progress)],
but semiconductor manufacturers were able to keep up with Moore's law
until 2015. 

In the folder "../data" is a comma separated value (CSV) file,
"transistor_data.csv" [taken from wikipedia
01/2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#Microprocessors).

a. Use the `!head ../data/transistor_data.csv` command to look at
the top of the csv. What are the headings for the columns?

b. Load the csv into a pandas dataframe. How many missing values
(`NaN`) are
in the column with the number of transistors? What fraction are
missing?

+++

## Part 1, Question 1.a

```{code-cell} ipython3
!head ../data/transistor_data.csv
```

The headings are Processor, MOS transistor count, Date of Introduction, Designer, MOSprocess, and Area

+++

## Part 1, Question 1.b

```{code-cell} ipython3
semiconductors = pd.read_csv('../data/transistor_data.csv')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(semiconductors)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
semiconductors
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
count_nan = semiconductors['MOS transistor count'].isna().sum()
    
print ('Count of NaN: ' + str(count_nan))
```

Fraction of NaN values is 7/186.

## Problems [Part 2](./02_Seeing_Stats.md)

1. Many beers do not report the IBU of the beer because it is very
small. You may be accidentally removing whole categories of beer from
our dataset by removing rows that do not include the IBU measure. 

    a. Use the command `beers_filled = beers.fillna(0)` to clean the `beers` dataframe
    
    b. Recreate the plot "Beer ABV vs. IBU mean values by style" 
    [bubble
    plot](https://cooperrc.github.io/computational-mechanics/module_02/02_Seeing_Stats.html#bubble-chart) with `beers_filled`. What differences do you notice between the plots?

+++

# Part 2, Question 1.a

```{code-cell} ipython3
beers = pd.read_csv("../data/beers.csv")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
beers
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
beers_filled = beers.fillna(0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
beers_filled
```

# Part 2, Question 1.b

```{code-cell} ipython3
ibu = beers_filled['ibu'].values
len(ibu)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
abv = beers_filled['abv'].values
len(abv)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
beers_styles = beers_filled.drop(['Unnamed: 0','name','brewery_id','ounces','id'], axis=1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
style_counts = beers_styles['style'].value_counts()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(style_counts)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
len(style_counts)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
style_means = beers_styles.groupby('style').mean()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
style_means
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
style_counts = style_counts.sort_index()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
style_counts[0:10]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from matplotlib import cm
colors = cm.viridis(style_counts.values)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
ax = style_means.plot.scatter(figsize=(10,10), 
                               x='abv', y='ibu', s=style_counts*20, color=colors,
                               title='Beer ABV vs. IBU mean values by style\n',
                               alpha=0.3);

for i, txt in enumerate(list(style_counts.index.values)):
    if style_counts.values[i] > 65:
        ax.annotate(txt, (style_means.abv.iloc[i],style_means.ibu.iloc[i]), fontsize=12)
```

What differences do you notice between the plots?: I notice that the bubble plot sizes are similar and represent the same numbers but the main difference is the range of x and y in that the beers_filled plot ranges its abv values starting at zero where the example starts at 0.04 abv, and the ibu values for beers_filled is 0 to 70 where as ibu in the example ranges from 20 to 100.

## Problems [Part 3](03_Linear_Regression_with_Real_Data.md)

1. There is a csv file in '../data/primary-energy-consumption-by-region.csv' that has the energy consumption of different regions of the world from 1965 until 2018 [Our world in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy). 
Compare the energy consumption of the United States to all of Europe. Load the data into a pandas dataframe. *Note: you can get certain rows of the data frame by specifying what you're looking for e.g. 
`EUR = dataframe[dataframe['Entity']=='Europe']` will give us all the rows from Europe's energy consumption.*

    a. Plot the total energy consumption of the United States and Europe
    
    b. Use a linear least-squares regression to find a function for the energy consumption as a function of year
    
    energy consumed = $f(t) = At+B$
    
    c. At what year would you change split the data and use two lines like you did in the 
    land temperature anomoly? Split the data and perform two linear fits. 
    
    d. What is your prediction for US energy use in 2025? How about European energy use in 2025?

2. You plotted Gordon Moore's empirical prediction that the rate of semiconductors on a computer chip would double every two years in [02_Seeing_Stats](./02_Seeing_Stats). This prediction was known as Moore's law. Gordon Moore had originally only expected this empirical relation to hold from 1965 - 1975 [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law),[2](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/gordon-moore-the-man-whose-name-means-progress)], but semiconductor manufacuturers were able to keep up with Moore's law until 2015. 

Use a linear regression to find our own historical Moore's Law.    

Use your code from [02_Seeing_Stats](./02_Seeing_Stats) to plot the semilog y-axis scatter plot 
(i.e. `plt.semilogy`) for the "Date of Introduction" vs "MOS transistor count". 
Color the data according to the "Designer".

Create a linear regression for the data in the form of 

$log(transistor~count)= f(date) = A\cdot date+B$

rearranging

$transistor~count= e^{f(date)} = e^B e^{A\cdot date}$

You can perform a least-squares linear regression using the following assignments

$x_i=$ `dataframe['Date of Introduction'].values`

and

$y_i=$ as `np.log(dataframe['MOS transistor count'].values)`

a. Plot your function on the semilog y-axis scatter plot

b. What are the values of constants $A$ and $B$ for our Moore's law fit? How does this compare to Gordon Moore's prediction that MOS transistor count doubles every two years?

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

```{code-cell} ipython3
data = pd.read_csv('../data/transistor_data.csv')
data = data.dropna()
xi=data['Date of Introduction'].values
TC=data['MOS transistor count'].values

## Problems [Part 4](04_Stats_and_Montecarlo.md)

__1.__ [Buffon's needle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon) is
another way to estimate the value of $\pi$ with random numbers. The goal
in this Monte Carlo estimate of $\pi$ is to create a ratio that is close
to [3.1415926...](http://www.math.com/tables/constants/pi.htm) _similar
to the example with darts points lying inside/outside a unit circle
inside a unit square._ 

![Buffon's needle for parallel
lines](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Buffon_needle.gif)

In this Monte Carlo estimation, you only need to know two values:
- the distance from line 0, $x = [0,~1]$
- the orientation of the needle, $\theta = [0,~2\pi]$

The y-location does not affect the outcome of crosses line 0 or not
crossing line 0. 

__a.__ Generate 100 random `x` and `theta` values _remember_ $\theta =
[0,~2\pi]$

__b.__ Calculate the x locations of the 100 needle ends e.g. $x_end = x
\pm \cos\theta$ _since length is unit 1. 

__c.__ Use 
[`np.logical_and`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.logical_and.html)
to find the number of needles that have minimum $x_{end~min}<0$ and
maximum $x_{end~max}>0$. The ratio
$\frac{x_{end~min}<0~and~x_{end~max}>0}{number~of~needles} =
\frac{2}{\pi}$ _for large values of $number~of~needles$_.

__2.__ Build a random walk data set with steps between $dx = dy =
-1/2~to~1/2~m$. If 100 particles take 10 steps, calculate the number of
particles that move further than 0.5 m. 

_Bonus: Can you do the work without any `for`-loops? Change the size of
`dx` and `dy` to account for multiple particles._

__3.__ 100 steel rods are going to be used to support a 1000 kg structure. The
